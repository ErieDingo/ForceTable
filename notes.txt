5/7/14 VectorTable004.html -- Trying to get location.reload() to 
recalculate the table but instead it reloads the html without 
recalculating the table. The reload goes directly to 
 document.getElementById("div1").appendChild(table1); This was
done without starting Apache web server.
5/8/14 VectorTable004.html Diagrams button now displays canvas.html.
VectorsPanel.html is for drawing vectors. Trying to pass vector set 
from VectorTable004.html to VectorsPanel.html.
5/9/14 Latest versions are in htdocs with names VectorTable.html, 
VectorsPanel.html.
5/13/14 VectorsPanel.html got message about losing Unicode. VectorsPanel001.html
is an attempt to save an earlier version.
Part of arrow is cut off. Vectors not within margins. Alert statements 
to be removed.
5/14/14 Second and third set of vectors are centered to the left. 
To see the bottom portion of the diagram, scrolling is required.
First set of vectors is centered to bottom of screen.
5/15/14 VectorsPanel005 is after centering set of vectors on screen.
5/16/14 VectorTable was modified to use insertRow(-1) and insertCell(-1). That
makes it compatible with both Internet Explorer and Chrome. Also made cells 
input capable. See http://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/ for a javascript 
spreadsheet.
5/20/14 VectorTable was modified to get input values.
5/22/14 VectorTable was modified to get a new set of vectors.
5/23/14 VectorTable was modified to allow deleting set of vectors.
When new set of vectors was entered and it was the only set, the components 
were shifted ahead by one element and the first x component was set
to zero. -- Fixed
6/13/14 VectorsPanel.html now has Resultant/Next Set button.
6/16/14 Path2D object not available yet for all browsers. Need to 
use the Polygon.contains() function already in VectorPanel.html.
6/20/14 Need to reverse sign of displayed y Components. Dash length
is too long. Need to display components for the resultant.
6/23/14 y component label gets cut off by width of canvas on left or right.
Sometimes component lines and labels are not on the best side (inside or
outside) of the enclosure formed by the added vectors. For example, make
the window smaller, then refresh, for the set with four vectors.
For R= 76.536 at 67.501deg.,A= 50 at 0deg.,B= 100 at 225deg.,C= 50 at 0deg., the vector
and component labels overlap and component labels from different vectors overlap.
