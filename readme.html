<pre>Force Table                Javascript version 1.2  03/09/17</pre>

<p><a href="VectorTable.html">Click here to go directly to Force
Table Data Entry</a></p>

<pre>There are two types of displays. The first is for entering vectors by specifying length 
and degrees. The other type displays a diagram of a set of vectors. </pre>

<pre>The data entry display:
Each row contains a column for length and a column for degrees. 
   The buttons:
      Next Set: Displays the next set of vectors.
      Diagrams: Switches to the diagram display.
      New Set (of x Vectors): Displays a blank series of rows. Change x to specify the 
         number of rows. 
      Delete Set: Deletes the currently displayed set of vectors.</pre>

<pre>The diagram display:
Each window displays a set of vectors as red arrows. There is a label at the top of the 
window that shows the numerical values for each vector. When the Resultant button is 
pressed, a blue resultant vector is also displayed and its numerical values are added to 
the label at the top of the window. The Resultant button changes to say Next Set. The 
Components button will display the components for each vector along with the numerical 
value of each component. The Next Set button will display the next set of vectors. The 
Enter Sets button switches to the data entry display. </pre>

<pre>The VectorTable.html file contains the numerical values of the vectors (except the 
resultant) to be displayed. The resultant is calculated by the computer. The Javascript 
statements in VectorTable.html that contain the initial values are:
    var tableSets = [[[230,48],[400,195]],
                     [[150,110],[300,180],[375,280]],
                     [[200,30],[300,70],[350,300],[400,280]]];
    var rowsInSet = [2,3,4];
These values get saved in a cookie with a 30 day lifespan.
</pre>

<pre>This version was rewritten in Javascript from an earlier Java applet. Since then 
Java has required a trusted certificate to run applets. The Javascript version 
depends on the use of a current browser. Force Table will not work with Windows 
Internet Explorer 8 and older versions of Internet Explorer. Other browsers such as
Chrome will run Force Table.</pre>
